# LCM LoRA Colab Notebook

This repository contains the code and instructions for running the LCM LoRA models on Google Colab with a T4 GPU. These models are based on stable diffusion models with LoRA distillation, which can synthesize high-resolution images with few-step inference. You can use these models to generate realistic and diverse images from various domains, such as faces, animals, landscapes, and more.

**You can Also Try on Google Colab for free & Make Sure to follow me:**

## Models

The LCM LoRA models include:

- **SDv1.5**: A stable diffusion model trained on ImageNet-64 with 1.5 billion parameters.
- **SDXL**: A stable diffusion model trained on ImageNet-128 with 3.2 billion parameters.
- **SSD 1B**: A super-resolution diffusion model trained on ImageNet-256 with 1 billion parameters.

## How to use

To use the LCM LoRA models, you need to have a Google account and access to Google Colab. You can try the models for free on Google Colab by following these steps:

<b>

### 1. Open the [LCM LoRA Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ayush-thakur02/LCM-LoRA/blob/main/LCM_LoRA.ipynb) in your browser.

### 2. Click on the Connect button at the top right corner of the notebook to connect to a runtime with a T4 GPU.

### 3. Execute the first cell to install the essential library and choose your base model. Then, download the Lora Model from the dropdown box.
